### 3. Data Types - Transactions and Categories

**Goal:** Learn Rust data types by defining transaction amounts and categories.

#### Task

1. Create a Rust project:
   ```sh
   cargo new finance_data_types
   ```
2. Modify `main.rs` to:
   - Define an `amount` variable as a floating-point number
   - Define a `category` variable as a string (e.g., `"Food"`)
   - Print `"Transaction: $<amount> spent on <category>."`

#### Output

```
Transaction: $45.99 spent on Food.
```
