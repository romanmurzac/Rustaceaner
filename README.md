# Rustaceaner

My journey in learning the **Rust** programming language.

The name comes from the official documentation name for the people that use Rust - *Rustaceans*, respectively one person - *Rustacean*, and some customization from my side - *Rustaceaner*.

Here will be described the whole path from first searc about Rust to time to move to another repository for a serious project using Rust.
